# potholes-and-garbage-detection Android App - OpenCV
An Android app that detects whether the captured image contains potholes or garbage. A new algorithm has been implemented that will not use image comparison but detection to classify the objects in the image. Furthermore, many new features have also been implemented. It is basically a Citizen Service application.
